# Overview

This is a repacked version of resedit and the supporting pe-library with esm and commonjs support.

Versions numbers will generally match the upstream resedit but patch versions may move ahead as needed.

# Usage

Usage is the same as resedit and pe-library. The only difference is that commonjs code can use the library normally without an async initialization.

# Bugs

Bugs are most-likely an upstream issue in resedit or pe-library, however if you have an issue related to the repacking please open a ticket under issues section for this repository.
